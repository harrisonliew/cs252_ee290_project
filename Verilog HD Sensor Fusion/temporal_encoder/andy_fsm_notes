1) steady in predict mode, NGRAM is full, continuously generating predictions with every new incoming spatial vector

	Bouncing between IDLE and FORWARD_QUERY 

2) new spatial vector comes in with different mode (train), possibly different label?

	IDLE -> IDLE, no bundle!

3) new spatial vector comes in with same mode (train), same label
